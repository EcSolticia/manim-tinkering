Manim is an animation engine for explanatory math videos. It's used to create precise animations programmatically, as demonstrated in the videos of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/).

This repository is a fork of Manim Community Edition for personal experimentation and learning. If you happened to have come across my fork in particular, and Manim is new to you, I'd recommend you have a look at the respective repositories for

- ManimGL - [3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim): The original Manim.
- ManimCE - [ManimCommunity/manim](https://github.com/manimcommunity/manim): Manim Community Edition, of which this repository is a fork for fiddling.
